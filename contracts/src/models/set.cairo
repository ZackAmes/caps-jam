/// The extensibility boundary between the core game and piece sets.
///
/// A "set" is a standalone contract that defines pieces (stats via
/// `get_cap_type`) and their abilities (via `activate_ability`). Anyone
/// can deploy a set; a game references one set contract and plays with
/// those pieces under the same core rules.
///
/// Set contracts are PURE FUNCTIONS: they receive a snapshot of relevant
/// state and return `SetOp`s (state-mutation intents) that the core
/// validates and applies. Sets never receive world access or mutable
/// state. See docs/SET_OPS.md.
