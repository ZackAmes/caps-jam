/**
 * This file provides a framework for running Cairo 2.x code in the browser
 * using a WebAssembly (WASM) build of the Cairo compiler and VM.
 * It is designed to work with a Cairo 2.8.4 compatible wasm-cairo build.
 *
 * Repository: https://github.com/cryptonerdcn/wasm-cairo
 *
 * Installation:
 * You'll likely need to add this as a git dependency in your package.json,
 * or build it from source and include it in your project's assets.
 * e.g., `npm install github:cryptonerdcn/wasm-cairo#<commit-hash-or-branch>`
 *
 * The package name in the import statement below ('wasm-cairo-2') is an
 * assumption. You may need to adjust it based on how you integrate the library.

/**
 * Simulates a "turn" by executing a Cairo function within the browser.
 *
 * This function demonstrates the end-to-end process:
 * 1. Initialize the WASM module for Cairo.
 * 2. Compile a string of Cairo source code into Sierra.
 * 3. Run the compiled Sierra code with specified arguments.
 *
 * Note: The function names `cairo_compile` and `cairo_run`, and their expected
 * signatures, are based on common patterns for such libraries. You may need to
 * inspect the actual exported functions from the wasm-cairo module you are using.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<any>} The result from the executed Cairo function.
